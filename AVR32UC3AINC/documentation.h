 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the SDRAMC on EBI driver.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the SDRAMC on EBI driver with the
 * onboard SDRAM. It initializes the SDRAM, tests it and then returns the number
 * of errors found.
 *
 * To use this code in your own application, make a pointer to the base address
 * of the SDRAM and access it like you would normally access a memory-mapped
 * device.
