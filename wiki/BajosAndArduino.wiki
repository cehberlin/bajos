*Run Bajos at Arduino*<br>
The Arduino Mega with the atmega1280 processor ( 128KB flash, 8 KB data ram) is well suitable for Bajos.<br>
There are many ways to install a java application at arduino.<br>
*1. Load BAJOS with arduino bootloader as standalone application*<br>
The simplest way is to use the preinstalled bootloader at arduino board which is normally used to burn the arduino applications with the arduino software environment and a linux pc environment.<br>
Download and unpack minikermit.tar.gz from [http://code.google.com/p/minikermit].<br>
Edit minikermit.c<br>
Uncomment:<br>
#define ARDUINOBOOTLOADER
#define MODEMDEVICE 	"/dev/ttyUSB0"	    /* USB port */<br>
if you connect your arduino via usb cable with the pc.<br>
and: <br>
#define BAUDRATE 	B57600 <br>
(thats the default baudrate of arduino bootloader).<br>
Compile from command line: <br>
#> g++ minikermit.c -lncurses -o minikermit<br>
generates the executable minikermit.<br>
You can test the communication between the arduino and the pc.<br>
Connect the arduino via usb cable with the pc, the green power led is on.<br>
Start minikermit:<br>
#>./minikermit<br>
Then reset the arduino with the reset button on board and type immediately 3 times '!' on
pc keypad.<br>
In the minikermit window you see a text similar: "ATmegaBOOT / Arduino Mega - (C) Arduino LLC - 090930".<br>
That shows all is ready for BAJOS.<br>
<br>Prepare BAJOS<br>
Download and unpack bajos.tar.gz from this page.<br>
Edit bajos/ARDUINOMEGA/arduinomega.inc<br>
#define BAUDRATE	57600	/* arduino bootloader default baudrate*/
Then compile bajos, generate bootclasses and compile application class (javatests/AM.class) with the make-utility in the bajos-dir:<br>
#>make clean  bootclasses compAM bootpack app compile bajospack<br>
creates bajos.bin which contains the virtual machines booclasses and the application class. Thats our binary file for upload at the arduino.<br>
Start minikermit (maybe there are outputs from an old pragram in arduino. Don't mind me.) 
and type 'w'. The minikermit window display the text: "name of bin file for uploading?".<br>
Type "bajos.bin". Bajos is uploading now and starts immediately.<br>

AM.java in the directory javatests is the running application class. It contains a test of the method currentTimeMilliSec and driver for the programmable board led. You can change this sourcecode and produce a new standalone bajos with the make-command line.
Other or mor application classes can be added by editing the arduinomega.inc file.
